This code is affiated to my Bachelor's degree defense thesis. In my thesis, I developed am alogorithm to calculate the Pair Distribution Functions from the regular X-ray diffraction device such as XRD. It cannot give a result as good as those in Synchrotron Labs, but still give a rough investigation on the local structures in the samples.

One potential application is we can use this code to find samples with poor quality, so that we won't waste time on them.
